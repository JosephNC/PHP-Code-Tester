# PHP-Code-Tester
A lightweight plugin that allows you to temporarily test code within your current WordPress instance.
The plugin is pretty much self-explanatory. It adds a code view to every page, which lets you execute any PHP code temporarily within your browser for a given WordPress instance. 

The PHP code gets executed on the plugins_loaded hook of WordPress.
